The Model Context Protocol (MCP) aims to provide secure, authenticated, and identity-aware interactions for AI systems. To effectively operate, MCP needs an underlying internet protocol that aligns with its core requirements for security, authentication, statefulness, bidirectional communication, efficiency, scalability, and compatibility with JSON-RPC.

## Key Requirements for MCP's Underlying Protocol

Based on the MCP specification, here are the crucial requirements for selecting an underlying internet protocol:

* **Security**: The protocol must support encryption and secure token handling, including protection against attacks like DNS rebinding.
* **Authentication and Identity**: It should enable authentication via OAuth 2.1, dynamic client registration, session management, and user consent mechanisms.
* **Statefulness**: The protocol needs to support or allow for the management of session state between clients and servers.
* **Bidirectional Communication**: Both client-to-server and server-to-client messaging are required for features like server-initiated requests and notifications.
* **Efficiency**: Given potentially large data transfers with AI interactions, the protocol should minimize overhead and handle data efficiently.
* **Scalability**: The protocol must support concurrent connections and multiplexing to handle multiple clients and servers in distributed environments.
* **Compatibility with JSON-RPC**: Since MCP is built on JSON-RPC 2.0, the transport must reliably carry JSON messages.
* **Support for Local and Networked Environments**: The protocol should be adaptable to both local (e.g., stdio) and networked environments (e.g., Streamable HTTP).

## Candidate Protocols

Let's evaluate several internet protocols against these requirements:

* **HTTP (HTTP/2 or HTTP/3)**: These versions of HTTP offer significant improvements over HTTP/1.1. They inherently provide **security** through TLS (HTTPS), align with MCP's **authentication** framework (OAuth 2.1), and support **statefulness** via headers or cookies. Both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 facilitate **bidirectional communication** through Server-Sent Events (SSE) and multiplexing. They are highly **efficient** with multiplexing and compression, and **scalable** for concurrent connections. Their **compatibility with JSON-RPC** is well-established, and MCP's Streamable HTTP transport already leverages HTTP.
* **WebSockets**: WebSockets enable full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. They are **secure** (WSS with TLS) and ideal for **bidirectional** and **stateful** interactions with low overhead for frequent small messages. They can effectively transport JSON-RPC messages. However, they lack built-in multiplexing or compression features found in HTTP/2.
* **gRPC**: A high-performance RPC framework built on HTTP/2 using Protocol Buffers. While offering **security**, **bidirectional streaming**, and **efficiency**, gRPC's reliance on Protocol Buffers conflicts with MCP's JSON-RPC foundation, making it an unsuitable choice.
* **Custom TCP-based Protocol**: While offering complete control, developing a custom protocol is highly complex and costly, requiring the reinvention of security, reliability, and scalability features readily available in existing protocols.
* **MQTT**: A lightweight pub/sub protocol primarily used in IoT. While efficient for small messages and scalable, MQTT's publish/subscribe model doesn't align with MCP's request-response (RPC) design.

## Analysis and Recommendation

MCP's existing reliance on **Streamable HTTP** as a transport, which utilizes HTTP POST, GET, and optional Server-Sent Events, strongly points toward **HTTP** as the optimal underlying protocol.

HTTP, particularly **HTTP/2** or **HTTP/3**, stands out as the most suitable choice due to its comprehensive feature set and widespread adoption:

* **HTTP/2** significantly enhances efficiency through multiplexing and header compression, which are crucial for handling large data transfers and multiple concurrent connections, addressing **scalability** and **efficiency** needs. It effectively supports **bidirectional communication** via Server-Sent Events.
* **HTTP/3**, built on **QUIC**, further improves performance by reducing latency and offering better resilience to network changes, which is highly beneficial for AI applications operating on variable networks.

Both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 seamlessly integrate with **TLS for security** and **OAuth 2.1 for authentication**, directly aligning with MCP's core requirements. Their inherent ability to handle **statefulness** through session management and their perfect **compatibility with JSON-RPC** make them ideal.

While WebSockets are excellent for real-time, low-overhead scenarios, they lack some of HTTP's advanced features like caching or chunked transfers, making them less suited for the full range of MCP's resource-heavy operations. Other protocols like gRPC, custom TCP, or MQTT are fundamentally misaligned with MCP's design principles.

Therefore, the most robust, secure, and efficient foundation for MCP is **HTTP**, with a strong preference for **HTTP/2 or HTTP/3** to maximize performance and scalability. This choice leverages established internet standards to enable seamless AI interactions across diverse environments.
