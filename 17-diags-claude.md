These diagrams represent the practical security architecture I've proposed for MCP environments. Let me explain how they work together:

1. **Extensible Security Middleware Architecture**: This shows how security plugins can be integrated into the MCP communication flow, with a Plugin Manager orchestrating different security functions like classification, flow control, and transformations.


```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Information Gateway Layer"
        direction TB
        PM[Plugin Manager]
        
        subgraph "Security Plugins"
            SP1[Classification Plugin]
            SP2[Flow Control Plugin]
            SP3[Transformation Plugin]
            SP4[Custom Security Plugins]
        end
        
        PM --> SP1
        PM --> SP2
        PM --> SP3
        PM --> SP4
    end
    
    MC[MCP Client] -- "Message" --> PM
    SP4 -- "Processed Message" --> MS[MCP Server]
```

2. **Dynamic Security Context Workflow**: Illustrates how trust scoring evolves throughout a session, with capability adjustments based on observed behavior - a key zero-trust principle implemented pragmatically.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant MC as MCP Client
    participant TS as Trust Scoring System
    participant CA as Context Analyzer
    participant PM as Policy Manager
    participant MS as MCP Server
    
    MC->>TS: Connection Request
    TS->>TS: Initialize Trust Score
    TS->>CA: Evaluate Initial Context
    CA->>PM: Apply Baseline Policies
    PM-->>MC: Capability Response
    
    loop Throughout Session
        MC->>TS: Request/Activity
        TS->>TS: Update Trust Score
        TS->>CA: Re-evaluate Context
        
        alt Degraded Trust
            CA->>PM: Adjust Active Policies
            PM->>MC: Attenuate Capabilities
            PM->>MS: Increase Monitoring
        else Improved Trust
            CA->>PM: Relax Restrictions
            PM->>MC: Restore Capabilities
        end
    end
```

3. **Protocol-Level Security Annotations**: Shows how MCP messages can be enhanced with security metadata like classification and integrity verification without redesigning the entire protocol.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "MCP Message"
        MSG[Message Content]
        
        subgraph "Security Field"
            CL[Classification]
            INT[Integrity Hash]
            SRC[Source Identifier]
            SEQ[Sequence Number]
            TR[Transformation Record]
        end
    end
    
    MSG --- CL
    MSG --- INT
    MSG --- SRC
    MSG --- SEQ
    MSG --- TR
    
    CL --> PL[Policy Enforcer]
    INT --> IV[Integrity Verifier]
    SRC --> SA[Source Authenticator]
    SEQ --> RA[Replay Attack Detector]
    TR --> TA[Transformation Auditor]
```

4. **Lightweight Attestation Protocol**: Demonstrates the challenge-response verification process between clients and servers, including the initial verification and ongoing re-attestation.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as MCP Client
    participant GCVL as GUARDRAIL Context Verification
    participant GRCL as GUARDRAIL Request Control
    participant Server as MCP Server
    
    Client->>GCVL: Initialize Connection
    GCVL->>Client: Send Attestation Challenge
    Client->>GCVL: Submit Attestation Data
    GCVL->>GCVL: Validate Client Environment
    
    GCVL->>Server: Request Server Attestation
    Server->>GCVL: Submit Server Attestation
    GCVL->>GCVL: Validate Server Environment
    
    alt Both Attestations Valid
        GCVL->>GRCL: Establish Trust Level
        GRCL->>Client: Complete Connection (with Trust Level)
    else Attestation Failed
        GCVL->>Client: Terminate Connection
        GCVL->>Server: Log Attestation Failure
    end
    
    loop Periodic Re-attestation
        GCVL->>Client: Re-attestation Challenge
        Client->>GCVL: Updated Attestation
        GCVL->>GCVL: Verify Consistency
    end
```

5. **Adaptive Resource Quotas**: Shows how resource limitations (CPU, memory, network, operations) can be dynamically adjusted based on trust score and threat levels.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Execution Containment Layer"
        TS[Trust Score] --> QE[Quota Engine]
        TL[Threat Level] --> QE
        
        QE --> CPU[CPU Quotas]
        QE --> MEM[Memory Quotas]
        QE --> NET[Network Quotas]
        QE --> OPS[Operations Quotas]
        
        subgraph "Resource Monitoring"
            RM[Resource Monitor]
            RM --> CPU
            RM --> MEM
            RM --> NET
            RM --> OPS
        end
        
        subgraph "Enforcement Actions"
            CPU --> THR[Throttling]
            MEM --> LIM[Limitations]
            NET --> BW[Bandwidth Control]
            OPS --> RL[Rate Limiting]
        end
    end
```

6. **Security Event Correlation and Reporting**: Illustrates how security events from different layers flow into a centralized analytics engine for filtering, correlation, and alerting.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "GUARDRAIL Layers"
        IGL[Information Gateway Layer]
        CVL[Context Verification Layer]
        RCL[Request Control Layer]
        ECL[Execution Containment Layer]
    end
    
    IGL --> ES[Event Stream]
    CVL --> ES
    RCL --> ES
    ECL --> ES
    
    subgraph "Security Analytics Engine"
        ES --> EF[Event Filtering]
        EF --> EP[Event Processing]
        EP --> CE[Correlation Engine]
        CE --> AP[Anomaly Processor]
        AP --> AR[Alert Router]
    end
    
    AR --> RT[Real-time Dashboard]
    AR --> SIEM[External SIEM]
    AR --> IR[Incident Response]
```

7. **MCP Security Integration Architecture**: Provides an overview of how these components work together in a complete security architecture.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Practical MCP Security Architecture"
        direction TB
        
        subgraph "MCP Client"
            MC[MCP Client]
            ESM1[Extensible Security Middleware]
            DSC1[Dynamic Security Context]
            PSA1[Protocol Security Annotations]
        end
        
        subgraph "MCP Server"
            MS[MCP Server]
            ESM2[Extensible Security Middleware]
            DSC2[Dynamic Security Context]
            PSA2[Protocol Security Annotations]
            ARQ[Adaptive Resource Quotas]
        end
        
        subgraph "Security Services"
            LAP[Lightweight Attestation Protocol]
            SECR[Security Event Correlation]
            SIEM[Enterprise Security Integration]
        end
        
        MC <--> ESM1
        ESM1 <--> DSC1
        ESM1 <--> PSA1
        
        MS <--> ESM2
        ESM2 <--> DSC2
        ESM2 <--> PSA2
        ESM2 <--> ARQ
        
        ESM1 <--> LAP
        ESM2 <--> LAP
        
        DSC1 --> SECR
        DSC2 --> SECR
        ESM1 --> SECR
        ESM2 --> SECR
        ARQ --> SECR
        
        SECR --> SIEM
    end
    
    MC <--> MS
```

This approach is more practical than the full GUARDRAIL framework because:

- Each component can be implemented independently
- Organizations can adopt only the parts they need
- It works with existing MCP implementations with minimal changes
- Performance impact is proportional to security requirements
- It maintains compatibility while enhancing security

The modular nature means developers can start with basic security annotations and the dynamic context, then add more sophisticated components like attestation and event correlation as their security requirements mature.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this architecture?
